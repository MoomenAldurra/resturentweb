                <p class="our1">Gabriel's journey began some years ago when he worked at a local roasted chicken
                    restaurant.
                    This experience, coupled with the unwavering support and encouragement from close friends and
                    family,
                    inspired him to take a leap of faith. In 2019, he transformed his backyard into a takeout
                    restaurant,
                    driven by a powerful motivation:
                    "To provide support for my family and ensure a quality education for my children."</p>
                <p class="our2">This dedication to his family became the cornerstone of Gabriel's work ethic. Every
                    Saturday
                    and Sunday, he rises early to begin the meticulous preparation of food and chickens for his
                    customers.
                    His commitment to quality and family values quickly resonated with the community,
                    and over the past five years, his takeout restaurant has flourished.</p>
